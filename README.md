Spring Boot Framework integrated with both OracleDB and MongoDB systems, to be deployed on Oracle VM.

Currently under development and testing.

It has dual setup for MySQL and OracleDB databases datasource, for now to handle permanent datas.
Please note that there is the production Spring Boot profile for the app which is not shown and included here in this repository so what you have would only be its localhost variants.
